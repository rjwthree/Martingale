### Martingale

The Martingale betting system usually describes a strategy in which one doubles the bet after each loss until winning, theoretically yielding a net gain equal to the initial bet.

In a coin flipping example, one could bet on heads repeatedly until winning. Imagine you start with a bet of $10 and the coin shows tails, so you bet $20 and lose again, so you bet $40 and finally win. You lost $30 from the first two bets but the overall outcome is a gain of $10.

But does this work in practice? In real gambling scenarios, no one can escalate betting amounts forever, either because of betting ceilings imposed by the house or limits on the wealth one can marshal.
